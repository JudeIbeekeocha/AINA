# Artificially Intelligent News Anchor (A.I.N.A.)

**Artificially Intelligent News Anchor (A.I.N.A.)** is an AI that fetches current news, summarizes them, and presents the information to you. 

## Inspiration
The inspiration behind AINA came from my desire to stay updated with financial news without the hassle of browsing through various sources. I often found that new sources or podcasts did not provide the specific information I was looking for. This led to the creation of AINA, a tool to quickly consume financial news in one place.

## Features
- **News Fetching**: Automatically retrieves the latest financial news from multiple sources.
- **Summarization**: Condenses news articles into concise summaries, focusing on key points.
- **Personalized News**: Provides the type of financial information you are interested in.

## Usage
To use AINA, simply run the script, and it will present you with the latest financial news summaries. Customize the sources and types of news you want to receive to fit your preferences.
